How I get ranked:

Things Me, Myself, and I consider while selling and buying:

Date of Release: The later the date, the higher the price unless the date is the same as today.

#/cc: the first number is for rankings, the second is availability.

Explained:

The # is for rankings. I go out to the leaderboards and based off the top 10 rankings I calculate if:

1. I am going for 1st on the set: I will offer 200-500k above Quidd Beta Pricing, compensate for the replacement, and offer to replace the one you’re selling to me with my previous low.

2. The item I am looking at can be bought to take the lead on me:  I will match their offer or go higher based off your asking price.

3. There is no way anyone can catch me on the leaderboards: I will offer the base price plus 200k more and replace the figure at a very discounted price. (Secret algorithm to determine if catchable)

The availability is hard to calculate since it is determined by the amount of Users that Quidd has that are interested in that collection. For instance if Quidd only has 10,000 people, and only 500 of them (at VERY MOST) collect Naruto, then if the cc is /1000 the card is not as valuable then if it were /250. (I use my computer science skills again for this. So I’ll keep this secret for my self)

That’s it. There is really no supply and demand or any above average magical thing I do to get ranked first and resell my items.

I put in about 500$ into Quidd and since then I’ve been able to stay at max cash with ease. 
Reason is, there is reassurance when people reply to my offer with “no way in hell” or “that price isn’t right”. I go off Quidd’s algorithm.. it’s there for a reason. Those who say Quidds pricing  estimate algorithm is wrong I reply... 

“yeah you’re probably right, the people that developed the application and everything to do with it got the resell value wrong... gosh how could I ever be so stupid to trust an app to tell me something about itself. Gah lee... ;)”

The bottom line is, the Quidd Beta algorithm is correct.The rankings/leaderboards competition drives the value of the item up. Think about it, the only thing that they can’t calculate is the want to be The #1 Collector on the leaderboard for a specific set.  It is a game after all, right?

Happy Quidding!!
